    "Create two lists for the station names and first years of operation for the stations in Group 1 in Table 2.5. Be sure to list the values in the order they appear in the table. Modify the lists you just created to add the values Group 2, again keeping them in the same order. Sort the two lists, sorting the first in alphabetical order and the second so that the most recent starting year is first Do you see any problems with how the lists have been sorted? Python has a function called zip() that might be helpful in solving the sorting issue. Search online to see whether you can find a way to use zip() to solve the problem with the two lists."
